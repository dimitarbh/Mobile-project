SmartphoneArena

SmartphoneArena is a comprehensive web application where users can view detailed smartphone specifications, comment on posts, and vote for their favorite phones. This project showcases a dynamic and interactive platform built using modern web technologies.

Project Plan
	The initial planning for this project was meticulously drafted using Excalidraw. You can view the project plan [here](https://excalidraw.com/#room=51082f2d76b1122f1413,U20MP2bYSEocNbaIkg6uqw).

Front-End Overview
	This repository contains the front-end code for the SmartphoneArena project. The front-end is built with React and several other powerful libraries to ensure a seamless user experience.

Key Features:
- View Smartphone Specifications: Users can browse through detailed specifications of various smartphones.
- Comment on Posts: Engage with other users by commenting on posts.
- Vote for Phones: Users can vote for their favorite phones, adding an interactive element to the platform.
Technologies and Libraries Used:
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React-Router-Dom: Enables dynamic routing in the application.
- Redux Toolkit: For state management, making the state predictable and easier to debug.
- React-Redux: Official React bindings for Redux.
- Redux-Thunk: Middleware for handling asynchronous actions in Redux.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the back-end API.
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive design and styling.
- React-Bootstrap: Bootstrap components built with React.
- Cheerio: Used for parsing HTML in the client.
- React-Icons: Provides popular icons as React components.
- Vite: Front-end build tool for a faster and leaner development experience.

Dynamic Data
	The project fetches dynamic data from a MongoDB database. The data includes smartphone specifications, user comments, and voting information, which are then rendered dynamically on the front-end.

Back-End
	The back-end of this project is written entirely by me. It handles data management, API endpoints, and database interactions to ensure smooth and efficient operations of the SmartphoneArena platform. You can see it ->
